An API which implements the basic CRUD operations for two tables: departments and users, characterized by a one to many relationship.
The API also supports image uploads for each user (the user's profile picture), it updates and keeps track of the uploaded images accordingly.
Finally, it has a barebones authentication system developed using JWT, with a dedicated route to check the logged in user.

I have developed this with the purpose of practicing back-end developement using Node.js - the application has no front-end part as of yet.
